[p]Welcome to my awesome text-only website!
Because who needs fancy images, colors, or any form of visual enjoyment when you can have........words.[/p]

[p]Prepare for an online experience so lightweight it could load on a toaster.
Actually, if you're reading this on a toaster: impressive, and also please stop.[/p]

[p]Here you get:

No pictures,no ads, no cookies, no pop-ups
No scripts demanding “access to your location”
And absolutely zero patience for anything complicated.[/p]

[p]It’s just you and text.
Elegant and chaotically boring.
The future of the internet, if everyone collectively gave up.[/p]

[p]Anyway, enjoy your stay. Or don’t. It’s text. It’s not going anywhere. :D
Will I win an award for my website? Probably not because it's just text.[/p] 

[p]This site is encrypted. :)[/p]
