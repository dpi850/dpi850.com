Hey there! Welcome to my super simple, text-only site! Forget images or anything fancy – it's all about the words here.
This site is so lightweight, it could probably load on a toaster. (If you're actually reading this on a toaster, that's amazing... but maybe stop?)
What you get: no pictures, no ads, no cookies, no pop-ups, no scripts asking for your location.
Basically, I have zero time for complicated stuff. It's just you and the text. Simple and maybe a little boring. It's the internet's future if everyone just gave up.
Anyway, have fun here! Or don't. It's just text, so it's not going anywhere.
Will my site win any awards? Nah, probably not. It's just text. P.S. This site is encrypted. :)
