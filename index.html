Welcome to my awesome text-only website!
Because who needs fancy images, colors, or any form of visual enjoyment when you can have........words.

Prepare for an online experience so lightweight it could load on a toaster.
Actually, if you're reading this on a toaster: impressive, and also please stop.

Here you get:

No pictures,no ads, no cookies, no pop-ups
No scripts demanding “access to your location”
And absolutely zero patience for anything complicated.

It’s just you and text.
Elegant and chaotically boring.
The future of the internet, if everyone collectively gave up.

Anyway, enjoy your stay. Or don’t. It’s text. It’s not going anywhere. :D
Will I win an award for my website? Probably not because it's just text.
